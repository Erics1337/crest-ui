# Badge

Compact status indicators for labeling states and categories.

## Examples

<Canvas>
  <Story of={BadgeStories.Default} />
  <Story of={BadgeStories.Variants} />
</Canvas>

## Guidance

- Use short labels; avoid full sentences.
- Prefer `neutral` or `outline` for low emphasis; `danger` sparingly.
