# Card

A surface container with rounded corners, soft elevation, and spacious rhythm.

## Examples

<Canvas>
  <Story of={CardStories.Basic} />
</Canvas>

## Guidance

- Use Card to group related content with clear visual hierarchy.
- Pair with tokens: `rounded-xl`, `shadow-low`, and calm color accents.
- Avoid overusing shadows; reserve for primary grouping and focus.
